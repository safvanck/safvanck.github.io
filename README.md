# Personal Website & Open Source Plug-ins (Draft Version)

## Overview

This project integrates **JavaScript (Node.js)** with **C** to deliver high-performance solutions for real-time processing and computationally intensive tasks. The system utilizes a sophisticated build pipeline along with HTML and Style scripts to manage both JavaScript and C code, ensuring high scalability and efficiency. It leverages **node-gyp** for compiling native C bindings and **Webpack** for bundling JavaScript code. The development environment is complex and requires careful setup to ensure seamless operation across platforms.

## Features

- **Native C modules** integrated seamlessly into a Node.js application for optimized performance.
- **Cross-platform** build pipeline using **Make** (Linux/macOS) and **node-gyp** for C code compilation.
- **Webpack** bundling for managing and optimizing JavaScript files.
- **Babel** for transpiling modern JavaScript syntax.
- Advanced build configurations to handle both JavaScript and C code dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **C**: For high-performance computational modules.
- **Make**: For compiling and linking C code.
- **node-gyp**: For building native C extensions for Node.js.
- **Webpack**: JavaScript bundling and optimization.
- **Babel**: JavaScript transpiling for ES6+ syntax.
- **ESLint**: Code linting for maintaining quality.
